# Introduction to OpenSensorHub
In the [previous training course](../Build_Driver/00_Introduction.md), you learned to build a stand alone driver for a KY-032 Arduino Sensor. The next set of training modules will introduce you to [OpenSensorHub (OSH)](https://opensensorhub.org/) and how to deploy an OSH Node. OSH Nodes are important components to the OpenSensorHub System and act as interactive hubs, capable of receiving requests, pushing observations, and participating in multi-node processes, whether on a local network or the internet. Each Node can support one or more sensor/actuator systems and can be deployed anywhere from the Cloud to the Edge
